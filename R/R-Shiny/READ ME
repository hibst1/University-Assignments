This project was the final assignment for the course in Data Science in Real Life. 
It was an analysis of the Parisian Airbnb Data which was then summarized into an R-Shiny.

Unfortunately, the data is too large to upload to Github at the moment. The code is available to see how we have tackled this issue and how we have made the Shiny. If you are interested in doing a replication, please contact me for the data, it is open source data, so I am able to share it freely. 

Uploading the data to Github is a planned next step to make the replication of this easier.
