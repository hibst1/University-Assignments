This project was the final assignment for the course in Data Science in Real Life. 
It was an analysis of the Parisian Airbnb Data which was then summarized into an R-Shiny.

In order to replicate this analysis, you will need to download the open source Airbnb Data found in the folder Data,
as well as the R script: Shiny_final_Aziz_Mekonnen.R . In order to make the replication as smooth as possible, it is best to
open a new R project and in that have the R script with the subfolder called Data, where the data will be stored.

It should then be easy to run the Shiny, just make sure to adjust the working directory to the new R proj that has both the 
data and the Shiny script, and press Run App. If you want to see the analysis without the Shiny, there is an Rmd file (Final_assignment_Aziz_Mekonnen.Rmd) attached in
this repository that gives insight into each calculation.
