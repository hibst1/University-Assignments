# University-Assignments

This repository shows some of the assignments that I have gotten the chance to work on throughout my studies. 
It is a summary of the code that I have been introduced to. To be specific, this repository is meant to show examples of how I code. For some of the assignments, I am not able to upload the data to make it replicatable. If there is any want to replicate what I have done, or if there are any questions, I am available and happy to answer any questions. 

Here, you will find work done in R, Matlab, and Stata.
